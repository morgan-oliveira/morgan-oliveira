- 👋 Hi, I’m @morgan-oliveira, self-taught backend developer.
- 👀 I’m interested in coding, specially back-end coding.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C# and NestJS, specifically practicing C# in a personal project (a mod for the sandbox game Terraria using the API tModLoader) and using NestJS in my full time job.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on backend projects.
- 📫 You can find me at Instagram (https://www.instagram.com/morgan.viana/) and Gmail (morgan.viana@hotmail.com)
