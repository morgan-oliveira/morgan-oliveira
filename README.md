- 👋 Hi, I’m @morgan-oliveira, and I'm a math undergraduate at Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte (Brazil)
- 👀 I’m interested in coding, specially back-end coding.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python alongside java, since I'm also interested in Electronics (doing a tech course at the same college)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on python apps, maybe some numpy. 
- 📫 You can find me at Instagram (https://www.instagram.com/morgan.viana/) and Gmail (morgan.matprof@gmail.com)
